Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *0.3.0*
We could get the version, so yes, a plain cwebp call works
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
