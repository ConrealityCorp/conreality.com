Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: *Exec failed* (return code: 1)

*Output:* 
'cwebp' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (WINNT)... We do.
Found 1 binaries:

Detecting versions of the cwebp binaries found

Binaries ordered by version number.

Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.
Creating command line options for version: 1.1.0
Quality: 100. 
Consider setting quality to "auto" instead. It is generally a better idea
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
