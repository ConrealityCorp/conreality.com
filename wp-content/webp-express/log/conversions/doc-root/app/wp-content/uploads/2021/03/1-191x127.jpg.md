Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: *Exec failed* (return code: 1)

*Output:* 
'cwebp' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

Nope a plain cwebp call does not work
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (WINNT)... We do.

Detecting versions of the cwebp binaries found
- Executing: X:\Openserver\domains\conreality.loc\app\wp-content\plugins\webp-express\vendor\rosell-dk\webp-convert\src\Convert\Converters\Binaries\cwebp-110-windows-x64.exe -version 2>&1. Result: version: *1.1.0*
Binaries ordered by version number.
- X:\Openserver\domains\conreality.loc\app\wp-content\plugins\webp-express\vendor\rosell-dk\webp-convert\src\Convert\Converters\Binaries\cwebp-110-windows-x64.exe: (version: 1.1.0)
Trying the first of these. If that should fail (it should not), the next will be tried and so on.
Creating command line options for version: 1.1.0
Quality: 100. 
Consider setting quality to "auto" instead. It is generally a better idea
The near-lossless option ignored for lossy
